                On the front, the phone has a 6.43-inch AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. This screen features an 8-bit color depth and 1100 nits of peak brightness. It is also IP53 rated for dust-and-splash resistance. Redmi Note 10S comes with a Z-axis haptic motor. Aside from that, it flaunts the Evol design, as seen on the other entries in the Note 10 series.

                Redmi Note 10S is powered by the Helio G95 chipset. As I mentioned earlier, it’s the only phone in the lineup so far to feature a MediaTek processor. This SoC comes with MediaTek’s HyperEngine technology that promises better management of resources (hardware and network) for smoother gameplay.

                Complementing the chipset is 6 or 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, which can be paired with either 64GB or 128GB UFS 2.2 internal storage. You can also expand the latter using a microSD card that gets a dedicated slot in the SIM tray.
