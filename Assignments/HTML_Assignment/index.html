            <h2>Design and Display</h2>
            <p>
                On the front, the phone has a 6.43-inch AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. This screen
                features an 8-bit color depth and 1100 nits of peak brightness. It is also IP53 rated for
                dust-and-splash resistance. Redmi Note 10S comes with a Z-axis haptic motor. Aside from that, it flaunts
                the Evol design, as seen on the other entries in the Note 10 series.

                    The MediaTek Helio G95 with MediaTek HyperEngine Gaming Technology gives you fast and smooth action
                    in your favorite titles through whole-device enhancements through four areas of enhancement that

            <p>
                Redmi Note 10S is powered by the Helio G95 chipset. As I mentioned earlier, it’s the only phone in the
                lineup so far to feature a MediaTek processor. This SoC comes with MediaTek’s HyperEngine technology
                that promises better management of resources (hardware and network) for smoother gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Complementing the chipset is 6 or 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM, which can be paired with either 64GB or 128GB UFS
                2.2 internal storage. You can also expand the latter using a microSD card that gets a dedicated slot in
                the SIM tray.

                <h3>Is Redmi Note 10S is 5G or not?</h3>
                <p>
                    The overall display quality is stunning. The performance is very solid with the MediaTek Dimensity
                    700 chipset. It supports 5G connectivity and is able to provide a decent gaming experience without
                    any stutter. For multitasking, there is 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage available in the Redmi
                    Note 10 5G.

            <h2>Camera</h2>
            <p>
                Redmi Note 10S has a quad-camera configuration with a 64MP f/1.79 main sensor leading the setup. This
                1/1.97” sensor has inarticleidual pixels that measure 0.7µm. It is accompanied by an 8MP f/2.2 ultrawide
                sensor with a 118º Field of View.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, there are two additional 2MP f/2.4 sensors for macro and portrait shots. The rear camera
                setup is capable of recording 4K videos at 30fps. You get a 13MP selfie shooter with AI Beautify
                upfront. It can record 1080p videos at 30fps.

                <p>
                    The camera on the Redmi Note 10 might not have the big 64MP or the 108MP sensor, but it is still
                    pretty solid considering the price. The 48MP camera can capture more details should you choose to
                    click in that mode, though remember it makes images heavier and these will take more space on your
                    phone.
